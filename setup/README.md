</h1>

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/lectures` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Make a new directory called `javascript-browser-game-rock-paper-scissors`, then enter this directory:

```bash
mkdir javascript-browser-game-rock-paper-scissors
cd javascript-browser-game-rock-paper-scissors
```

Then, create an `app.js` and an `index.html` file. These files will hold your work for this lecture:

```bash
mkdir js css
touch index.html js/app.js css/style.css
```

With the files created, open the contents of the directory in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

Open the `index.html` file and add HTML boilerplate. Then make use of the `app.js` file by adding this line inside the `<head>` tag:

```html
<script defer src="./js/app.js"></script>
```

With this setup complete, we'll have two methods at our disposal for executing the code we write in `app.js`:

- Open the `index.html` file in your browser and access the console output in your browser's dev tools.

- Use `node` to execute the `app.js` file directly by using this command in your terminal:

```bash
node app.js
```

While either method is acceptable, you should use the same method as your instructor for simplicity.
